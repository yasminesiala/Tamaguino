#🐣 Tamaguino — Modified Arduino Tamagotchi Clone

This project is my custom, expanded, and personalized version of the original Tamaguino digital pet created by Alojz Jakob. His project includes the full game logic, UI, and animations.

Original project: https://alojzjakob.github.io/Tamaguino/
All core logic, art, animations, and design belong to their respective creators.
My repo contains personal modifications and additions.

My version rebuilds the hardware using an Arduino Nano, adds a few new features, cleans up parts of the code, and includes my own custom 3D-printed Tamagotchi-style enclosure (basically the Tamagotchi I never had growing up).

##What I Changed / Added
	Hardware Changes
		- Switched from Arduino Pro Mini → Arduino Nano (more memory + easier USB programming).
		- Using the internal pull-up resistor version
		- Cleaned up wiring for the OLED display and buttons
		- Added a speaker for simple sound effects
		- Added a light sensor (LDR + resistor) for potential brightness-based behavior or “sleep mode.”
		- Designed and 3D-printed my own enclosure inspired by classic Tamagotchis.
	Software Changes
		- Added a mood system (happy / neutral / sad) with matching animations
		- Added a startup splash screen
		- Improved button responsiveness on the Nano
		- Cleaned up portions of the code structure 
		- Minor adjustments to OLED layout for clearer text spacing.
		- Added placeholders for future features:
				EEPROM save/load
				Mini-games
				More animations
				Sound upgrades

##Parts I Used: 
	- 0.96" I2C OLED Display (128×64)
	- 3× momentary push buttons
	- Small speaker
	- Slide switch
	- 150mAh LiPo battery
	- LiPo charging board
	- 10k resistor
	- 7×5 cm prototyping PCB
	- Wires

##Wiring Summary: 
	OLED
		VCC -> 5V
		GND -> GND
		SDA -> A4
		SCL -> A5
	Buttons -> digital pins
	Light Sensor
		LDR -> A0
		LDR -> 5V
		10k resistor -> A0 -> GND
	Speaker -> digital pin & GND
